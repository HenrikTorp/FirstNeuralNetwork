# Neural Network Project

This project showcases the first neural network I built entirely from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn for the core implementation. The underlying mathematical structure, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent, was implemented using NumPy.

External libraries were only used for:
- **Dataset Loading**: TensorFlow was used to import the MNIST dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` was used to split the custom made dataset, and TensorFlow was used for one-hot encoding the labels.

This project demonstrates my understanding of neural networks and machine learning fundamentals. Feel free to explore the code and try it out!
